# Cat Treasure
*By: Erik Vodopivec Forsman*

A command-line dungeon-crawler game where you play as a cat. 

## The classes
I chose to make classes for the player, the rooms, the doors and the directions. The reason for making the directions into a class was that I could give them both a status and a name. The alternitive was to make 8 variables. The rest of my classes were chosen based on the fact that they exist in the instruction example (combined with practicality). 

### Player
`DungeonRoom pos;
    Boolean status;`
Pos shows the players current position and status shows if the player is alive or not.

### Rooms
`int roomId; 
    String roomDesc;
    DungeonDoor conn1;
    DungeonDoor conn2;
    DungeonDoor conn3;`
The rooms consist of an id, a description and 3 connected doors. The id is for identification and the description contains information about the room which is then shown to the user. The connected doors are for making movement between rooms possible. Conn1 is a door to the north, conn2 is either west or east and conn3 is south. 

### Doors
`int doorId;
    Boolean locked;`
Just as with the rooms, the door id is for identification. The locked boolean is a preparation for further game logic. It shows if a door is locked or not.

### Directions
`String dirName;
    String dirString;
    boolean status;`
DirName shows which direction it is and status shows if it is one of the available options (if there is a room to that direction).

### Treat
`String treatName;
    String treatString;
    boolean status;`
The treats work like healing and damage potions. The status shows if the player has one or not.

#### Damage treats
`int damage;`
This treat damages the enemy.

#### Health treats
`int healing;`
This treat heals the player.

### Mob
`boolean boss;
    String mobName;
    boolean status;
    int health;
    int damage;`
The boss boolean tells the program if the enemy is a boss or not.

#### Leaves
Leaves are not bosses. They are low level enemies.

#### Vaccum
`boolean superAttack;
    int superCharge;
    int superDamage;`
Vaccums are bosses. They have a special attack (superAttack) that gets charged up a bit after every normal attack. 

### Key
`String keyName;
    boolean status;
    DungeonRoom keyPos;`
Keys open locked doors. KeyPos shows where the key is located. The status shows if the user has a key.

## The logic
The logic of the game is contained in a while loop which runs as long as the player's status is "true". This is so that the game will end when the player dies (status is set to "false").

The program then checks how many doors are connected to the room in which the player is and which directions they face. When that is done the user gets the choices available and makes a decition on where to go. Based on the input from the user, the player's position is changed to the correct room. Then the logic starts over. 

If there is an item or mob in the room, the logic for handling that will run before the user can choose a direction to go in. Mobs are handled before items.

### Mob fights

### Items (including keys)
